### The code I submitted for my exercise and assignments of CS102A 2022 Spring

* **assignment\final is the final submitted version for OJ**  
It may be the first version that was all accept, but not always the best version I wrote.

* **assignment\demos is my attempts and tests**  
It contains some immature ideas, unoptimized method, and tests for new syntax.
